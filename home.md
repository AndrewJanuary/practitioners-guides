##### At Scott Logic we have a number of experts with a track record of successful delivery across technical projects and we are drawing on that collective experience to bring you our Practitioner's Guides.

The Practitioner's Guides are designed to add value and perspective to IT professionals, tackling issues that we feel aren't addressed elsewhere.

We are aiming to publish guides on a regular basis on to equip you with broad knowledge and expertise to help you deliver business objectives through technology. 

<!-- 
The Practitioner's Guides are designed to be small practical guides for IT professionals - authored by the team at [Scott Logic](https://www.scottlogic.com/). We draw on our collective experience to tackle topics that we don't feel are addressed elsewhere. Our hope is that these little 'value adds' will help you just as much as they have helped us.

Topics covered include:
