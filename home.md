**At Scott Logic we have a number of experts with a track record of successful delivery across technical projects and we are drawing on that collective experience to bring you our Practitioner's Guides.**

The Practitioner's Guides are designed to add value and perspective to IT professionals, tackling issues that we feel aren't addressed elsewhere.

We are aiming to publish guides on a regular basis on to equip you with broad knowledge and expertise to help you deliver business objectives through technology.
