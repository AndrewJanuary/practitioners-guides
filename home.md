# About

Practitioners Guides offers a collection of guides created by [Scott Logic](https://www.scottlogic.com/) to be used by software professionals and practitioners. 

These guides aim to provide guidance and advice on a wide range of software-related challenges that come up on a day-to-day basis when building, maintaining, and working with software systems and applications.

Topics covered include:

- Remote Workshop Experiences
- Project Week One Advice

The goal of Practitioners Guides is to help share knowledge and recommended approaches across the practitioner community. The guides offer direction rooted in real-world experience from various levels of professionals at Scott Logic.

We hope these guides will prove valuable references for professional software developers and engineers looking to expand their skills and tackle new challenges.

The Practitioners Guides site is an ongoing project, where we expect new guides to be published on a somewhat regular basis.
