# Contributing to the Practitioners Guides repository
The Practitioners Guide Repository is a collection of guides curated to share experiences and best practice. We welcome contributions that improve the quality of our existing content, such as fixing typos, formatting errors or making clarifications.

## Reporting Issues
If you come across any issues while using or reading our guides, please report them by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the Issues tab of the main repository.

2. Click the "New Issue" button.

3. Fill out the issue template, providing as much detail as possible about the problem you encountered.

4. Submit the issue, and our team will review and address it accordingly.

## New Guides
We are not currently accepting contributions for entirely new guides to add to the repository. The scope and structure of the practitioner's guide is currently defined by Scott Logic only.
